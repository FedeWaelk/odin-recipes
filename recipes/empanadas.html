    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup warm water</li>
    <li>1/4 cup melted beef fat or lard (or vegetable oil if preferred)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>For the filling:</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>500g (1 lb) beef, cut into small cubes</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 green onions, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon pimenton or paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon beef fat or lard</li>
    <li>2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 cup green olives, chopped</li>
    <li>Raisins grapes to taste (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
    <p>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt.
Gradually add the warm water and melted beef fat or lard, mixing until a smooth dough forms.
Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.
Cover with a cloth and let rest for 30 minutes.</p>
    <li>Prepare the Filling:</li>
    <p>In a skillet, heat the beef fat or lard over medium heat.
Add the onions and green onions, and cook until soft and translucent.
Add the beef, paprika, cumin, salt, pepper and raisins (if using). Cook until the beef is tender, about 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
Add the chopped hard-boiled eggs and olives, and mix well.</p>
    <li>Assemble the Empanadas:</li>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F), or prepare a deep pan for frying if you prefer fried empanadas.
Divide the dough into small balls and roll each one into a thin, round disc about 4-5 inches in diameter.
Place a spoonful of the beef filling in the center of each disc.
Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Press the edges firmly and crimp with your fingers or a fork to seal.</p>
    <li>Cook the Empanadas:</li>
    <p>For Baked Empanadas: Place them on a baking sheet, brush with melted beef fat or lard, and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
For Fried Empanadas: Heat oil in a deep pan and fry the empanadas in batches until golden and crispy, about 5 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels.</p>
    <li>Serve:</li>
    <p>Serve the empanadas warm, you can garnish with spicy llajua sauce if desired. Buen provecho!</p>
