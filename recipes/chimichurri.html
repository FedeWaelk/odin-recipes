    <h3>Green, uncooked sauce for meat.</h3>
    <p>
        Chimichurri is an uncooked sauce used as an ingredient in cooking and as a table condiment for grilled meat. Found originally in Argentina and used in Argentinian, Uruguayan, Paraguayan and Brazilian cuisines, it has become widely adopted in most of Latin America.

        This sauce may be basted or spooned onto meat as it cooks, or onto the cooked surface of meat as it rests. Chimichurri is often served as an accompaniment to asados (grilled meats). It may be served with grilled steaks or roasted sausages, but also with poultry or fish.
