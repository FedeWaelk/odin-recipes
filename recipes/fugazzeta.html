    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fugazzetta is a variation on fugazza in which the cheese is baked in between two pizza crusts (usually media masa), and the onions are placed on top.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fugazza and its variations are believed to have been invented by a Genoese-Argentine pizza maker named Juan Banchero sometime between 1893 and 1932, who served it out of a pizza shop bearing his name. Banchero's pizza shop continues to sell fugazza to this day in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of La Boca, which historically served as a home to Genovese immigrants to Argentina.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><em>For the dough:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>10 grams of salt</li>
        <li>10 grams of sugar</li>
        <li>25 grams of fresh yeast or 7 grams of dry yeast</li>
        <li>300 ml warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>For the filling and topping:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Olive oil for sautéing the onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
        <p>In a large bowl, mix the flour with salt and sugar.
Dissolve the fresh yeast in warm water (if using dry yeast, mix it directly with the flour).
Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the water with dissolved yeast, along with the 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
Mix well until a soft and smooth dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour.</p>
        <li>Knead the Dough:</li>
        <p>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes until it is elastic and smooth.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rest in a warm place for about 30 minutes or until doubled in size.</p>
        <li>Sauté the Onions:</li>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a skillet, heat a bit of olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until golden. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <li>Assemble the Fugazzeta:</li>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 220°C (428°F).
Divide the dough into two parts. Roll out one part and place it on a pre-oiled baking sheet.
Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella over the rolled-out dough.
Roll out the second portion of dough, place it over the cheese layer, and press the edges to seal.</p>
        <li>Add the Topping:</li>
        <p>Spread the sautéed onions over the top layer of dough, covering the entire surface.
Sprinkle with dried oregano.</p>
        <li>Bake the Fugazzeta:</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted.
Remove from the oven and let rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
